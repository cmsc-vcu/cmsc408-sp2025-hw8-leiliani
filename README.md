## Overview

For this assignment, I am working as a data analyst for the World Bank, using the World Development Indicators (WDI) database. The datasets are large, so I need to be careful with how I manage interim tables to ensure efficient analysis.

The World Bank is an international organization focused on reducing poverty and promoting economic development through financial support, grants, and research.

The WDI is a major database maintained by the World Bank, containing key economic and social development data. I used it to perform analyses on global development trends and challenges.

The goal of this project was to explore and manipulate the World Bank WDI (World Development Indicators) dataset using SQL. By querying, cleaning, updating, and organizing country data, we practiced fundamental SQL skills like SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS, CASE statements, and subqueries.
